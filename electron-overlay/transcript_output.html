                         Okay. Okay, so this is a question. I want you to design a class that supports these three operations. So the first operation is inserting a value, and you can assume that there's no duplicates allowed. So you might be given a duplicate, but you don't want to actually store the duplicate.
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="buffer-item">
                        <span class="buffer-speaker interviewer">[Interviewer]</span>
                         Moving a value from this class and where it gets interesting is I want you to be able to get a random value that is already inserted. And among the values that are inserted, I want it to be of equal probability.
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="buffer-item">
                        <span class="buffer-speaker interviewer">[Interviewer]</span>
                         So just these three operations.
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="buffer-item">
                        <span class="buffer-speaker candidate">[You]</span>
                         Thank you.
                    </div>
