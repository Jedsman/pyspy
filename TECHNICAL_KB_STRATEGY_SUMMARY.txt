INTERVIEW COACH - TECHNICAL KB STRATEGY SUMMARY
================================================================================

YOUR QUESTION:
"Can technical questions (software, DevOps, architecture, best practices) be
handled just by system prompt or by using prompt injection?"

ANSWER: Use KB Injection (recommended)

================================================================================
3 APPROACHES COMPARED
================================================================================

1. SYSTEM PROMPT ONLY
   ✗ Generic answers (from tutorials)
   ✗ Not grounded in your experience
   ✗ Inconsistent across sessions
   ✗ No control over sources
   → AVOID

2. CUSTOM PROMPT INJECTION
   ✗ High overhead per question
   ✗ Not archived with sessions
   ✗ Defeats purpose of interview coach
   ✗ User must write prompts
   → NOT RECOMMENDED

3. KB INJECTION (RECOMMENDED)
   ✓ Personal answers (your experience)
   ✓ Technical grounding (best practices)
   ✓ Consistent across sessions
   ✓ Sources archived
   ✓ Easy to update
   → USE THIS

================================================================================
HOW KB INJECTION WORKS
================================================================================

Question: "How do you design a system for 10M users?"

Process:
  1. Claude calls retrieve_answer(question)
  2. KB searches (BM25 + embeddings, ~10ms):
     - system_design_principles.txt (score: 0.95)
     - kubernetes_guide.txt (score: 0.92)
     - career_history.json (score: 0.90)
  3. Claude reads KB documents
  4. Claude synthesizes answer:
     "At GSK, I handled 1M requests/day using [approach].
      For 10M, I'd scale by [best practice pattern]..."
  5. Answer blends: Your experience + Best practices + Technical depth

Result: Personal + Technical + Grounded ✅

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (30 MINUTES)
================================================================================

1. Create KB structure
   mkdir -p ~/.interview_coach/profiles/default/documents/technical_reference

2. Add 4 technical documents (copy from INTERVIEW_COACH_BUILD_KB.md)
   - 01_system_design_principles.txt
   - 02_kubernetes_guide.txt
   - 03_devops_best_practices.txt
   - 04_microservices_patterns.txt

3. Update career history
   ~/.interview_coach/profiles/default/career_history.json

4. No changes to system prompt needed
   Already configured to use retrieve_answer()

5. Test
   python test_interview_coach.py

================================================================================

Winner: KB Injection ✅

================================================================================
EXAMPLE: REAL INTERVIEW FLOW
================================================================================

Question: "How do you ensure system reliability?"

WITHOUT KB Injection (generic):
  "I would use monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures.
   This helps detect issues quickly and recover faster."
  Problem: Could be copy-paste from any blog

WITH KB Injection (grounded):
  "At GSK, we implemented:
   1. Monitoring: Prometheus for metrics, Datadog for logging
   2. Alerting: SLO-based alerts (error rate > 0.1%)
   3. Incident response: On-call rotation, runbooks, post-mortems
   4. Kubernetes: Liveness/readiness probes with auto-restart
   5. Deployment: Canary deploys with automatic rollback

   When a service goes down, it's detected within seconds,
   routed around automatically, and paged to on-call."

   ✅ Personal (your projects)
   ✅ Technical (from KB docs)
   ✅ Detailed (grounded in experience)

================================================================================
WHY KB INJECTION WINS
================================================================================

1. GROUNDING
   Answers reference actual documents you control
   Interviewer sees: "This person has thought about this"

2. CONSISTENCY
   Same KB docs always produce similar answers
   Easy to learn what works

3. VERIFIABILITY
   "This principle is from devops_best_practices.txt"
   You can cite your own KB

4. MAINTAINABILITY
   New concept? Just add to KB
   No need to rewrite system prompt

5. TRACEABILITY
   Sessions archived with KB sources
   Learn which topics were asked
