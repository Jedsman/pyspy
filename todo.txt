# Feature Port from feat/gemini-mcp to feat/claude-mcp

## Completed Iterations

✅ ITERATION 1: Port config.py and update MCP server to use it
  ✅ Test: Verify MCP server still works with Claude Desktop after config.py changes

✅ ITERATION 2: Port Electron .env setup and screenshot path configuration
  ✅ Test: Verify Electron overlay still loads and connects

✅ ITERATION 3: Port enhanced screenshot capture workflow (desktopCapturer)
  ✅ Test: Capture a screenshot manually via overlay button, verify file saves to Z:\
  ✅ Fix: Update MCP server to return ImageContent for screenshots
  ✅ Fix: Add view_screenshot tool for Claude to view images
  ✅ Test: Verify Claude Desktop can view screenshots using view_screenshot tool

✅ ITERATION 4: Port custom prompts enhancements (action types)
  ✅ Test: Verify custom prompts UI works (edit, add, delete)
  ✅ Test: Verify 'capture' action triggers screenshot workflow

## Parked for Later

⏸️ ITERATION 5: Port text input in live buffer and WebSocket text prompt support
  - Features:
    * Add text input field to live transcript buffer
    * Allow typing custom prompts directly in overlay
    * Press Enter or dedicated button to send
    * WebSocket support for sending text prompts
  - Test: Type a prompt in live buffer, press Enter/capture, verify it works

⏸️ ITERATION 6: Port WebSocket remote command support (server triggers capture)
  - Features:
    * WebSocket client in overlay.html connects to server (on PC1)
    * Listen for remote commands like:
      - { type: 'capture_screenshot' } → triggers screenshot workflow
      - { type: 'analyze_text_prompt', prompt: 'text' } → sends text prompt
    * Allows PC1's web_server.py to remotely control PC2's Electron overlay
  - Test: Trigger screenshot from web_server.py, verify overlay responds

## Summary

Successfully ported core features:
- Centralized config with environment-based paths (Z:\ for PC2, local for PC1)
- Enhanced screenshot capture using desktopCapturer API
- MCP server integration with Claude Desktop
- view_screenshot tool for viewing images in Claude Desktop
- Custom prompts with action types (copy vs capture)

System Architecture:
- PC1: Runs Python system, hosts shared folder
- PC2: Runs Electron overlay + Claude Desktop + MCP server
- Z:\ on PC2 maps to generated_code folder on PC1
- Screenshots saved to Z:\screenshots, accessible by both machines
- MCP server exposes screenshots to Claude Desktop via view_screenshot tool
