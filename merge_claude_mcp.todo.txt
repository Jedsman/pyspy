# Merge feat/claude-mcp into feat/expert-mcp TODO
# Tracking the integration of Claude Desktop MCP features into the golden branch

## Overview
Merge feat/claude-mcp (Claude Desktop integration) into feat/expert-mcp (Gemini-based golden branch)
to create a unified system supporting both Claude and Gemini as LLM backends with a router pattern.

Source branches:
- GOLDEN: feat/expert-mcp (current working branch, based on feat/gemini-mcp)
- SOURCE: feat/claude-mcp (contains Claude Desktop integration to be merged)
- REFERENCE: feat/gemini-mcp (original Gemini-only branch)

## Key Decisions
✓ KEEP custom_system_prompt - actively used for inline prompts from MCP and hotkeys
✓ KEEP WASAPI audio fix - already working in expert-mcp, no changes needed
✓ REMOVE test files - test_loopback.py, test_wasapi_loopback.py, test_websocket.py
✓ DEPRECATE gemini_mcp_client.py - not actively used, archive for future reference
✓ BUILD LLM Router - clean abstraction for Claude/Gemini/future LLM backends

## Rollback Plan

If any stage fails, use this recovery procedure:

### Quick Rollback
1. Note which stage failed
2. Identify the last successful commit
3. Run: git reset --hard {last_successful_commit}
4. Note the failure details
5. Resume from failed stage with fixes

### Reference Commits
- Before Stage 1: `git log --oneline -1` (save this)
- Before Stage 2: `git log --oneline -1` (save this)
- etc.

### Save Work In Progress
- Before each stage: create backup branch
  ```
  git branch backup-before-stage-X
  ```
- If stage fails: `git reset --hard backup-before-stage-X`

## Notes for Context Recovery

If resuming work:

1. Current branch: feat/expert-mcp
2. Source branch: feat/claude-mcp (for reference)
3. Golden base: feat/gemini-mcp (original)
4. Main differences between feat/claude-mcp and feat/expert-mcp:
   - MCP server enhancements (new tools, ImageContent)
   - Claude Desktop configs
   - Updated audio capture (keep expert-mcp version)
   - Config.py flexibility
   - Dependency updates

5. Key preservation items:

   - Keep WASAPI fix from expert-mcp
   - Keep all existing Gemini functionality as default
   - Remove test files (not needed)
   - Archive gemini_mcp_client.py (not used)

6. If implementing LLM Router in Stage 4:
   - Extract existing Gemini logic into GeminiRouter
   - Keep CodeGenerator as orchestrator
   - Make router pluggable for future LLMs
   - Ensure custom_system_prompt flows through router

7. Git workflow:
   - Make one commit per stage
   - Test thoroughly before moving to next stage
   - Keep commits atomic and reversible
